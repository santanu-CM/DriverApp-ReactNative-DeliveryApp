## Step 1: Start Metro

First, you will need to run **Metro**, the JavaScript build tool for React Native.

To start the Metro dev server, run the following command from the root of your React Native project:

```sh
# Using npm
npm start

# OR using Yarn
yarn start
```


Update @react-native-documents/picker new || react-native-document-picker is old

npm i @d11/react-native-fast-image  new || react-native-fast-image

@react-native-clipboard/clipboard || @react-native-community/clipboard old

react-native-star-rating-widget || react-native-star-rating

npx react-native-asset
